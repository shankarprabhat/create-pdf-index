    "content": " \n \n \nGuideline for good clinical practice E6(R2)   \nEMA/CHMP/ICH/135/1995  Page 6/68 \n \n \nIntroduction \nGood Clinical Practice (GCP) is an international ethical and scientific quality standard for designing, \nconducting, recording and reporting trials that involve the participation of human subjects. Compliance \nwith this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety and well-being of trial subjects are \nprotected, consistent with the principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, and that \nthe clinical trial data are credible. \nThe objective of this ICH GCP Guideline is to provide a unified standard for the European Union (EU), \nJapan and the United States to facilitate the mutual acceptance of clinical data by the regulatory \nauthorities in these jurisdictions. \nThe guideline was developed with consideration of the current good clinical practices of the European \nUnion, Japan, and the United States, as well as those of Australia, Canada, the Nordic countries and \nthe World Health Organization (WHO). \nThis guideline should be followed when generating clinical trial data that are intended to be submitted \nto regulatory authorities. \nThe principles established in this guideline may also be applied to other clinical investigations that may \nhave an impact on the safety and well-being of human subjects. \nADDENDUM \nSince the development of the ICH GCP Guideline, the scale, complexity, and cost of clinical trials have \nincreased. Evolutions in technology and risk management processes offer new opportunities to \nincrease efficiency and focus on relevant activities. When the original ICH E6(R1) text was prepared, \nclinical trials were performed in a largely paper-based process. Advances in use of electronic data \nrecording and reporting facilitate implementation of other approaches. For example, centralized \nmonitoring can now offer a greater advantage, to a broader range of trials than is suggested in the \noriginal text. Therefore, this guideline has been amended to encourage implementation of improved \nand more efficient approaches to clinical trial design, conduct, oversight, recording and reporting while \ncontinuing to ensure human subject protection and reliability of trial results. Standards regarding \nelectronic records and essential documents intended to increase clinical trial quality and efficiency have \nalso been updated. \nThis guideline should be read in conjunction with other ICH guidelines relevant to the conduct of \nclinical trials (e.g., E2A (clinical safety data management), E3 (clinical study reporting), E7 (geriatric \npopulations), E8 (general considerations for clinical trials), E9 (statistical principles), and E11 (pediatric \npopulations)). \nThis ICH GCP Guideline Integrated Addendum provides a unified standard for the European Union, \nJapan, the United States, Canada, and Switzerland to facilitate the mutual acceptance of data from \nclinical trials by the regulatory authorities in these jurisdictions. In the event of any conflict between \nthe E6(R1) text and the E6(R2) addendum text, the E6(R2) addendum text should take priority. \n  "

Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) \nIn the pre-approval clinical experience with a new medicinal product or its new usages, particularly as \nthe therapeutic dose(s) may not be established: all noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal \nproduct related to any dose should be considered adverse drug reactions. The phrase responses to a \nmedicinal product means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event \nis at least a reasonable possibility, i.e. the relationship cannot be ruled out. \nRegarding marketed medicinal products: a response to a drug which is noxious and unintended and \nwhich occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of diseases or for \nmodification of physiological function (see the ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management: \nDefinitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting). \n1.2.  Adverse Event (AE) \nAny untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a \npharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. \nAn adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal \nlaboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal \n(investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product (see the \nICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited \nReporting). \n1.3.

That storage times and conditions are acceptable, and that supplies are sufficient throughout \nthe trial. \nii. That the investigational product(s) are supplied only to subjects who are eligible to receive it \nand at the protocol specified dose(s). \niii. That subjects are provided with necessary instruction on properly using, handling, \nstoring, and returning the investigational product(s). \niv. That the receipt, use, and return of the investigational product(s) at the trial sites are \ncontrolled and documented adequately. \nv. That the disposition of unused investigational product(s) at the trial sites complies with \napplicable regulatory requirement(s) and is in accordance with the sponsor. \nd) Verifying that the investigator follows the approved protocol and all approved amendment(s), if \nany.

    "content": "The Investigator's Brochure (IB) is a compilation of the clinical and nonclinical data on the \ninvestigational product(s) that are relevant to the study of the product(s) in human subjects. Its \npurpose is to provide the investigators and others involved in the trial with the information to facilitate \ntheir understanding of the rationale for, and their compliance with, many key features of the protocol, \nsuch as the dose, dose frequency/interval, methods of administration: and safety monitoring \nprocedures. The IB also provides insight to support the clinical management of the study subjects \nduring the course of the clinical trial. The information should be presented in a concise, simple, \nobjective, balanced, and non-promotional form that enables a clinician, or potential investigator, to \nunderstand it and make his/her own unbiased risk-benefit assessment of the appropriateness of the \nproposed trial. For this reason, a medically qualified person should generally participate in the editing \nof an IB, but the contents of the IB should be approved by the disciplines that generated the described \ndata. \nThis guideline delineates the minimum information that should be included in an IB and provides \nsuggestions for its layout. It is expected that the type and extent of information available will vary with \nthe stage of development of the investigational product. If the investigational product is marketed and \nits pharmacology is widely understood by medical practitioners, an extensive IB may not be necessary. \nWhere permitted by regulatory authorities, a basic product information brochure, package leaflet, or \nlabelling may be an appropriate alternative, provided that it includes current, comprehensive, and \ndetailed information on all aspects of the investigational product that might be of importance to the \ninvestigator. If a marketed product is being studied for a new use (i.e., a new indication), an IB \nspecific to that new use should be prepared. The IB should be reviewed at least annually and revised \nas necessary in compliance with a sponsor's written procedures. More frequent revision may be \nappropriate depending on the stage of development and the generation of relevant new information. \nHowever, in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, relevant new information may be so important that \nit should be communicated to the investigators, and possibly to the Institutional Review Boards \n(IRBs)/Independent Ethics Committees (IECs) and/or regulatory authorities before it is included in a \nrevised IB. \nGenerally, the sponsor is responsible for ensuring that an up-to-date IB is made available to the \ninvestigator(s) and the investigators are responsible for providing the up-to-date IB to the responsible \nIRBs/IECs. In the case of an investigator sponsored trial, the sponsor-investigator should determine \nwhether a brochure is available from the commercial manufacturer. If the investigational product is \nprovided by the sponsor-investigator, then he or she should provide the necessary information to the \ntrial personnel. In cases where preparation of a formal IB is impractical, the sponsor- investigator \nshould provide, as a substitute, an expanded background information section in the trial protocol that \ncontains the minimum current information described in this guideline."

    "content": "Essential Documents are those documents which individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a trial and the quality of the data produced. \nThese documents serve to demonstrate the compliance of the investigator, sponsor and monitor with the standards of Good Clinical Practice and with all \napplicable regulatory requirements. \nEssential Documents also serve a number of other important purposes. Filing essential documents at the investigator/institution and sponsor sites in a \ntimely manner can greatly assist in the successful management of a trial by the investigator, sponsor and monitor. These documents are also the ones which \nare usually audited by the sponsor's independent audit function and inspected by the regulatory authority(ies) as part of the process to confirm the validity \nof the trial conduct and the integrity of data collected. \nThe minimum list of essential documents which has been developed follows. The various documents are grouped in three sections according to the stage of \nthe trial during which they will normally be generated: 1) before the clinical phase of the trial commences, 2) during the clinical conduct of the trial, and 3) \nafter completion or termination of the trial. A description is given of the purpose of each document, and whether it should be filed in either the \ninvestigator/institution or sponsor files, or both. It is acceptable to combine some of the documents, provided the individual elements are readily identifiable. \nTrial master files should be established at the beginning of the trial, both at the investigator/institution’s site and at the sponsor's office. A final close-out of \na trial can only be done when the monitor has reviewed both investigator/institution and sponsor files and confirmed that all necessary documents are in the \nappropriate files. \nAny or all of the documents addressed in this guideline may be subject to, and should be available for, audit by the sponsor’s auditor and inspection by the \nregulatory authority(ies). \nADDENDUM \nThe sponsor and investigator/institution should maintain a record of the location(s) of their respective essential documents including source documents. The \nstorage system used during the trial and for archiving (irrespective of the type of media used) should provide for document identification, version history, \nsearch, and retrieval. \nEssential documents for the trial should be supplemented or may be reduced where justified (in advance of trial initiation) based on the importance and \nrelevance of the specific documents to the trial."
